If you're just lost on GitHub, visit our [website](https://planb.network) to learn more about Bitcoin.

However, we hope you're here to contribute, so here we will present the inner workings of this content management system and how you can assist us -- either by adding new material or translating/proofreading content in your language.

Thank you for your time, involvement, and effort in this project. Here, we believe in a [value-for-value model](https://dergigi.com/2021/12/30/the-freedom-of-value/) and we'll do our best to reciprocate your contribution on the basis of your Proof-of-Work. Moreover, by participating in the creation of valuable Bitcoin resources for your local community, you could also get some useful insight into how to spread that knowledge locally.

# Why do we do it?

Plan ₿ Network was born from our belief in the transformative power of Bitcoin to create a decentralized future. We are inspired by the Cypherpunk Manifesto, which emphasizes the importance of knowledge as the foundation of freedom and change. Our ultimate goal is to empower individuals all over the world with the knowledge they have been deprived of, in order to revolutionize the world.

# How does it work?

Plan ₿ Network helps communities worldwide get organized to provide better education. The platform develops the necessary tools to achieve this goal through the [online academy](https://planb.network/courses), the [tutorials portal](https://planb.network/tutorials), and the [resource portal](https://planb.network/resources).

Before getting onto the platform, contents are published here, in this repository, as a central public
place for Bitcoin Education. Any piece of content is specifically formatted to
facilitate data parsing and (so) rendering on websites or apps.

## Repository Structure

This repo is organized around three main directories, which are:

- `courses`, comprising all the courses about Bitcoin, Lightning, Cryptography, Mining, and so on.
- `resources`, consisting of various types of resources about Bitcoin, such as books, videos, or podcasts.
- `tutorials`, containing "how-to" articles, categorized into themes like exchange, merchant, node, privacy, and so on.

Each individual piece of content, which is a markdown file, is defined by its location in this tree structure and by its language (indicated in the name code). For instance, the Italian tutorial about Nerd-Miner would have the following path:

```
./tutorials/mining/nerd-miner/it.md
```

If you want to learn more about our repo structure and content format, check out our [documentation](./docs/README.md).

Instead, if you want to have a bird-eye view of our published content and proposals, check the below:

- [Course Dashboard](https://github.com/orgs/PlanB-Network/projects/5)
- [Tutorial Dashboard](https://github.com/orgs/PlanB-Network/projects/6)
- [Resources Dashboard](https://github.com/orgs/PlanB-Network/projects/4)

## Incentive model: Value-4-Value

We believe in the power of Proof Of Work and how it enables a value-4-value model. In the words of one of the greatest poets of our times, DerGigi, we consider time, talent and treasure. Thus, we are committed to give back to those who enrich us with their time and talent.

In practical terms, it means that any task (content creation, peer-reviewing,
proofreading), explicitly as an individual Github issue, is correlated to a reward in sats. When the issue is closed, the reward is sent to the contributor who completed the task.

If you want to learn more about it, go have a [look here](#why-value-4-value-PoW-model?)

# How can you contribute?

Bitcoin is for everyone, and so is Plan ₿ Network, which means that everyone who has a specific talent can contribute to the growth of the network. Whether you are a nerdy, super coder or a social media influencer, your knowledge and skills are essential to spread Bitcoin knowledge across the world.

## Be a node of the network

Another way to contribute might be to become a Plan ₿ Network Node. A node is a Bitcoin community that has a physical hub and wants to move to the next step to accelerate local Bitcoin adoption! There are no requirements regarding the size of its community: what is important is its dedication and the Proof-of-Work already done for the local peers.

At Plan ₿ Network, we aim to improve the Bitcoin education ecosystem by providing the right tools to educate others and create local projects. So, by becoming a node, your community will get access to a large range of resources, services, special training, and more.

If you want your community to be a reference in the Bitcoin world, learn more about how to become a node [here](https://planb.network/en/node-network).

## Be a Bitcoin Educator

If you have created some Bitcoin educational content, whether in the form of a video, book, podcast, blog, or even an entire course, Plan ₿ Network will grant you the right visibility on our global platform. We can provide the tools to translate your teaching materials and share them with people who speak many different languages.

As an educator, your role is crucial. In fact, without your dedication and passion, Bitcoin only remains a piece of information. Instead, we want people to understand that Bitcoin is precious and the knowledge of it will pass through generations.

To propose your content directly, you can first reach out via the
[Telegram Group](https://t.me/PlanBNetwork_ContentBuilder) to get assistance.

## Join the Proofreading Team

The key to making education powerful is to make it accessible to everybody in the world. Not everyone speaks English, or every other language on Earth! However, we are sure that together, as a network, we can make Bitcoin educational resources as open-source as the seven seas, by translating them into many languages.

If you are confident that you can help us proofread our content, we are eagerly looking for you! Just reach out via the [Telegram Group](https://t.me/PlanBNetwork_ContentBuilder).

Literally EVERY LANGUAGE is needed!

The image above displays the percentage of static elements on our website that have been translated, per language. Feel free to reach out if you want to add your language to the platform!

### How to add a new language on PBN

If you are enthusiastic about this initiative and you would like to help us, please add your local language to the github repo and the website. Kindly follow the following steps:

1. Join the [Contributors TG group](https://t.me/PlanBNetwork_ContentBuilder) and present the languages you speak.
2. You will be contacted by our team member and maybe added to a specific group dedicated to one language.
3. The first step will be to [add the new language](https://planb.network/tutorials/others/contribution/add-new-language-weblate-eef2f5c0-1aba-48a3-b8f0-a57feb761d86) on the Weblate app (an account on Weblate is required).
4. Then, you can [start translating the static elements](https://planb.network/tutorials/others/contribution/translate-front-weblate-8213b931-650f-4efd-8f4e-9a8ae5ce6295) of the website.
5. When you finish, go back to the [TG group](https://t.me/PlanBNetwork_ContentBuilder) or reach out to the translation coordinator to inform them you have completed the task.
6. Thanks to the [LLM-Translator](https://github.com/Asi0Flammeus/LLM-Translator), or other tools, we will translate the BTC101 course to benchmark with you the automatic translation accuracy.
7. [Start proofreading](https://planb.network/tutorials/others/contribution/content-review-tutorial-1ee068ca-ddaf-4bec-b44e-b41a9abfdef6) BTC101 on GitHub (an account on GitHub is required) in the corresponding language after the approval of the coordinator.
8. After you finish and we merge the PR, we will send you the reward in sats for both contributions, using a Lightning Network invoice or LN address.
9. If the automatic translation is good enough, we will translate all the educational content of Plan ₿ Network and publish it on the website.
10. Then, anyone will be able to choose any content in that language to proofread and receive the associated reward.

# Why do we use the value-4-value PoW model?

Well, because we don’t see any other way. What is the problem with the internet nowadays? It's that we think we are getting everything for free, but, in reality, we are the product. In fact, our data is used for the benefit of others. Since we believe in the freedom to choose how we handle our data and knowledge, we ensure that everything we share, build, and contribute in this open-source model is paid for in a value-for-value fashion.

## How do we do it?

Our first goal is to gather all the amazing content that has already been created (you can find everything on our website).

But there is a catch: we want to reach every corner of the world! For this reason, we need everyone to collaborate with their own language skills. We can't get to all the people in Bangladesh if we don't have the content in Bengali.

Therefore, we have implemented this incentive model. First, you will get paid per task (content creation,proofreading): there is a whole payment system set in place by Asi0 -- if
you are curious about it, you will find some details in the [documentation](./docs/value-4-value-model.md). In short,
each content type has a formula based on various parameters like the number of words, the content difficulty, and other criteria, so the reward associated to each task is
defined in the assigned issue.

## What's next?

It's simple: as people read or use your content, they will rate it. The better the rating you get as a proofreader or verifier, the more proofreadings you will receive. This is what we like to call a proof-of-work structure.

The better the quality of your work, the more content you will get. The more value you receive, the more value WE all receive.

**LONG LIVE VALUE-FOR-VALUE!**

# End Goal: Overcome the language barriers in Bitcoin Education

So that's it, that's our plan to take over the world! We seek every role, in every language: proofreaders, educators, and most importantly, individuals that are eager to learn.

If you believe you are one of them, [reach out](https://t.me/PlanBNetwork_ContentBuilder). We want to collaborate!
