bio: |
  Passionate about Bitcoin and convinced that education is the key, I wish to share with you the little knowledge I have and thus contribute to the adoption of Bitcoin. Otherwise, I'm a big fan of Pink Floyd, I'm learning to code, and I make memes. Looking forward to meeting you at the next meet-up!
  I am the creator of the training course BTC 205 - Non-KYC Purchase Solution.
