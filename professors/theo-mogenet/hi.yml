bio: |
  Professor at Kedge Bordeaux, I teach Bitcoin and the economic theories of the Austrian School, and am the founder of the Bitcoin Institute, an educational and training company located in Paris. I am passionate about economics, history, literature, political science, and technology. I enjoy skiing, wine, whisky, steaks, and conversation. Being well-versed in everything but an expert in nothing, I've decided to dedicate myself full-time to Bitcoin education.
  I am the creator of ECON 201 - introduction to Austrian economics.
