Hello everyone! Passionate about bitcoin since 2018, I developed an inclination towards economics and hyperinflation. I strive to share my passion through the ECON204 course on hyperinflation and also through my book "Tous sur Bitcoin". Looking forward to discussing with you at the upcoming bitcoin conferences!
