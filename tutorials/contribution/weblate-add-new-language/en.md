Plan ₿ Network's mission is to provide first-class educational resources on Bitcoin and translate them into as many languages as possible. Much of the content published on the site is open-source and hosted on GitHub, allowing anyone to participate in enriching the platform. Contributions can take various forms: correcting and proofreading existing content, updating information, or creating new tutorials to add on the platform.

Our website currently provides a range of languages, and we are continually working to add more. To improve the translation process for our frontend, we use the Weblate tool, which helps us collaborate and manage translations efficiently. It's a user-friendly tool.

If your native language is not yet available on our website and you would like to add it, this tutorial is for you!

First, make sure to contact the Plan ₿ Network team via our [Telegram group](https://t.me/PlanBNetwork_ContentBuilder). If you don't have Telegram, you can send an e-mail to mari@planb.network. Make sure to write a small presentation about who you are and the languages you speak.

## Checking if a Language is presente on the Weblate

To check if your language is already among those we are working on.

- Go to [our Weblate platform](https://weblate.planb.network/projects/planb-network-website/):
![language](assets/01.webp)
- In the `Website elements` menu, you will find a list of all the languages in progress:
![language](assets/02.webp)
If your language is in this list, you do not need to add it again. To contribute by proofreading the weblate, discover the following tutorial:

If your language is not there, follow the tutorial below to add it.

## Adding a New Language to Plan ₿ Network

- The first step is to create an account on Weblate by clicking on "Register" in the upper right corner (if you need any help, you can go back to the tutorial mentioned just above).

- Once your account is created, go to the `Website elements` menu and select the `Languages` tab:
![language](assets/03.webp)
- Click on the `+` on the upper left of the window:
![language](assets/04.webp)
- Open the dropdown list and select the language you wish to add. If the language you are looking for is not available in the dropdown list, you can reach out on the [Telegram group](https://t.me/PlanBNetwork_ContentBuilder) so our team can create it manually:

- Click on `Start new translation`:

- To start translating the static elements of the website, click on the `Translate` button: ![language](assets/08.webp)
To be guided through the translation process, check our dedicated tutorial here below:

Congratulations, you have started the process of translating the static elements on the Plan ₿ Network's website!
They include all the strings on the website, except the educational content (courses, tutorials...) for which we use another semi-automated method (AI translation + contributors proofreading).

A big thank-you for your valuable contribution!
