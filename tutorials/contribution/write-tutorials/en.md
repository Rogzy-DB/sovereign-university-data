Plan ₿ Network's mission is to make leading educational resources on Bitcoin available in as many languages as possible. All content published on the site is open-source and hosted on GitHub, giving anyone the opportunity to participate in enriching the platform. Contributions can take many forms: correction and proofreading of existing texts, translation into other languages, updating of information or even creation of new tutorials not yet available on our site.

In this tutorial, we'll look at how to add new content, such as a tutorial or course, to the Plan ₿ Network platform.

## What's the difference between a tutorial and a course?

The two main sections of our platform are courses and tutorials. Courses provide theoretical educational resources, while tutorials offer practical content showing how to use a specific tool (for example, a hardware wallet or software) or a particular practice (such as securing a mnemonic phrase or checking the authenticity of software).

Courses are naturally longer and more structured than tutorials. They should explore a specific topic related to Bitcoin or its ecosystem in depth, precision and detail.

Tutorials are generally shorter. They are intended as step-by-step guides on how to perform a specific Bitcoin-related task, with images as support.

## How do I suggest a new course?

If you have an idea for a Bitcoin course that is not yet present on the platform and would like to write it, you can contact us at the following address:

contact@planb.network

In your message, please introduce yourself briefly and describe your course idea. If you already have an idea for the structure of your course, please also include the individual chapters. We'll get back to you as soon as possible to explain how to proceed and, if necessary, discuss the structure of your course.

## How do I submit a new tutorial?

To add a new tutorial to Plan ₿ Network, you can do so directly on GitHub by submitting a Pull Request. In the tutorial below and the accompanying tutorials, I take you step-by-step through this process and inform you of the guidelines to follow to ensure your tutorial's compatibility with the platform, while maintaining a clear contribution history.

## 1 - Choose a theme for your tutorial

We are primarily looking for tutorials on tools related to Bitcoin or its ecosystem. This content can be divided into six main categories:


- Portfolio ;
- Node ;
- Mining ;
- Merchant;
- Exchange ;
- Confidentiality.

Beyond these topics specifically related to Bitcoin, Plan ₿ Network is also looking for contributions on topics that emphasize individual sovereignty, such as:


- Open source tools ;
- IT ;
- Cryptography ;
- Energy ;
- Mathematics;
- Economy;
- DIY;
- LifeHacking...

For example, we currently have tutorials on Tails, Nostr and GrapheneOS. These tools are not directly related to Bitcoin, but they are systems that could be of interest to us as part of a move towards sovereignty in the digital world. These contents can be integrated into a sub-category of the "Others" section.

You can either design a tutorial from scratch, or take a tutorial previously published on your website (provided you own the copyright) and share it on Plan ₿ Network too, adding a link to the original article.

Whichever you choose, please bear in mind that all content published on Plan ₿ Network is licensed under a free [CC-BY-SA](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) license. This license authorizes anyone to copy and, potentially, modify your content, on the sole condition that the original source is duly credited.

## 2 - Contact the Plan ₿ Network team

Once you've chosen the theme for your tutorial, the next step is to inform us of your intention to add this content to the platform. The easiest way, if you have a Telegram account, is to [join our group](https://t.me/PlanBNetwork_ContentBuilder).

Introduce yourself briefly and specify the specific content you'd like to write, as well as the language you'd like to write in, by sending a message in the "General" channel. A team member will then create an issue on GitHub corresponding to your future contribution.

If you do not have a Telegram account and prefer not to create one, you can also contact us by email at the following address

paolo@planb.network

## 3 - Choosing the right tools to contribute

To contribute to Plan ₿ Network, you have 3 options depending on your level of experience with GitHub:


- Experienced users**: Continue with your usual methods and simply consult the short tutorial below which summarizes the Plan ₿ Network repository file structure, specific requirements and working method :

- Intermediate (GitHub Desktop)** : If you're not familiar with using Git, the first option is to easily set up your own local environment to contribute to Plan ₿ Network. This approach is recommended for significant contributions, such as writing a full tutorial. To do this, follow the step-by-step tutorial below :

- Beginners (web interface)** : You can also opt to use GitHub's web interface directly, without having to set up a complete local environment. This method can be considered for minor contributions. However, for major contributions, such as adding a complete new tutorial, this option may prove more complex than setting up a local environment. I'll explain how to do this in this tutorial:

Choose one of these three options according to your level of knowledge, then get started writing your first Plan ₿ Network tutorial!
