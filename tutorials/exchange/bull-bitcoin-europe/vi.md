Bull Bitcoin is a Bitcoin-only exchange platform founded in 2013 in Canada by Francis Pouliot, an iconic figure in the Bitcoin ecosystem. Bull Bitcoin's philosophy is to offer users tools for financial sovereignty and emancipation. The exchange platform is non-custodial, which means you always remain sovereign over your Bitcoins.

Initially available only in Canada, the platform is now available in Europe, with a brand-new, optimized interface. This new version of Bull Bitcoin is currently only available in Europe. It enables you to buy and sell bitcoins quickly and easily, thanks to the use of Lightning and instant SEPA transfers. Eventually, the platform will also include options for DCA, automatic purchases, limit orders and bill payments in bitcoins.

Bull Bitcoin makes a point of providing a transparent service with no hidden charges. Like all other exchange platforms in Europe, using Bull Bitcoin requires KYC (customer identification procedure).

## KYC

To access the full functionality of Bull Bitcoin, which is a regulated platform, you need to perform identity verification (KYC). Click on "*Continue Verification*".

![BULL](assets/fr/14.webp)

Select "*Personal Account*".

![BULL](assets/fr/15.webp)

Fill in your personal information and follow the steps of the verification process. You will be asked :


- Your first and last name ;
- Your telephone number ;
- Your postal address ;
- Your date of birth, your profession and your intentions on the platform (invest, sell, pay, etc.);
- ID and a selfie;

![BULL](assets/fr/16.webp)

This verification should be confirmed shortly. Once validated, you will have access to all the features offered by the platform.

## Deposit fiat money

Before you start buying and selling bitcoin on Bull, it's important to understand that the platform never stores your sats. This means that to buy bitcoin, you must immediately transfer your funds to a self-custody wallet. Similarly, to sell, you need to send your bitcoins from a self-custody wallet to Bull. They will then be converted into fiat currency on receipt. It is not possible to store bitcoins directly on the platform. However, you can keep a balance in euros.

To get started, you'll probably want to deposit some euros with Bull to buy your first sats. Click on "*Deposit funds*".

![BULL](assets/fr/17.webp)

Select "*SEPA transfer*".

![BULL](assets/fr/18.webp)

The platform's bank details will be displayed. Make an instant SEPA transfer to the beneficiary indicated, from a bank account in your name (the same as the one used for KYC on the platform). Be sure to include the transfer code shown on this page in the description of the transfer.

![BULL](assets/fr/19.webp)

As soon as we receive your transfer, your balance in euros will be updated.

![BULL](assets/fr/20.webp)

## Buy bitcoins

Now that you've credited your account with euros, it's time to buy your first sats. Click on "Buy Bitcoin".

![BULL](assets/fr/21.webp)

Enter the amount you wish to purchase. You'll also need to choose how you want to withdraw your sats. For small amounts, I recommend the Lightning option, but on-chain or Liquid withdrawals are also available. In the latter case, you'll need to provide the address to which to send the funds. Once you've filled in your details, click on "*Continue*".

![BULL](assets/fr/22.webp)

If you're not familiar with using Bitcoin, Lightning or Liquid wallets, I suggest you take our dedicated training course:

Then confirm your purchase by clicking on "*Confirm Buy*".

![BULL](assets/fr/23.webp)

For my part, having opted for a withdrawal via Lightning, I have three options for recovering my sats:


- LNURL by scanning a QR code ;
- By providing my Lightning address ;
- By providing an invoice for the amount of the purchase.

The LNURL method is the simplest. It is available in most Lightning portfolios, such as Phoenix, where you simply select "*Receive*" then "*Scan*".

![BULL](assets/fr/24.webp)

Your bitcoins are now secure in your wallet.

## Selling bitcoins

To sell bitcoins, the procedure is very simple. Click on "*Sell Bitcoin*".

Enter the amount you wish to sell and select the method for transferring the sats to Bull Bitcoin. For small amounts, I recommend the Lightning option. Then click on "*Continue*".

![BULL](assets/fr/27.webp)

Choose the account to which you would like to receive the euros from the sale. You can select your account on the platform or an external bank account. Click on "*Continue*".

![BULL](assets/fr/28.webp)

The instructions for carrying out the transaction are then displayed. In my Lightning example, I'll be paying an invoice.
