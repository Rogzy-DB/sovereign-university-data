**Important notes on other portfolios**

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: Before selling sats, make sure your portfolio supports "hold" invoices, which are used by the bot as an escrow system.


- Wallet of Satoshi**: Works well for receiving sats, but can have delays in updating the balance if a sale is cancelled.
- Muun**: Not recommended as payments may fail due to bot routing fee limits (maximum 0.2%).
- Aqua**: Works to receive sats, but can have long delays (up to 48 hours) for balance updates in the event of a sale cancellation.

üí° **Tip**: For optimum experience, opt for recommended portfolios (Breez, Phoenix or Blixt).

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: Don't forget to save your recovery phrases in a safe place.

### How to sell Bitcoins

**1. Create a sales offer**

![Cr√©ation d'une offre de vente](assets/fr/06.webp)

To create a sales offer, simply use the command :

`/sell`

The bot will then guide you step by step:

1. Choose your currency

2. Indicate the amount of satoshis to sell

3. For the price, you have two options:


   - Set a fixed price for the quantity of satoshis
   - Use the market price with the option of applying a premium (positive or negative)

üí° **Tip**: The premium allows you to adjust your price in relation to the market price. For example, a premium of -1% means you're selling for 1% less than the market price.

**2. Confirmation of order creation**
