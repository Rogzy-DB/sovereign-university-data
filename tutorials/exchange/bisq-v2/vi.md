## Introduction

KYC-free peer-to-peer (P2P) exchanges are essential for preserving users' confidentiality and financial autonomy. They enable direct transactions between individuals without the need for identity verification, which is crucial for those who value privacy. For a more in-depth understanding of the theoretical concepts, take a look at the BTC204 course:

### What is Bisq 2?

Bisq 2 is the new version of the popular decentralized Bisq exchange, launched in 2024. Unlike its predecessor, Bisq 2 has been developed to support multiple exchange protocols, offering users greater flexibility.

**Key new features:**


- Support for multiple privacy networks (Tor, I2P)
- Multiple identities for greater confidentiality
- REST API for trading bots
- Support for multiple portfolio types
- Role system with compulsory deposit in BSQ

This guide focuses exclusively on "Bisq Easy", the only protocol currently available. Bisq Easy has been designed specifically for new Bitcoin users. This protocol enables users to buy and sell Bitcoins against fiat currencies on a decentralized peer-to-peer platform. Transactions are limited to the equivalent of 600 USD (with a minimum of 6 USD), and exchange security relies on the reputation of BTC sellers. Bisq Easy has no trading fees or security deposit requirements. Bisq Easy is expected to replace Bisq 1 for cash exchanges below 600 USD (or equivalent).

**Main features:**


- Cross-platform desktop application
- Several exchange protocols available
- Decentralized P2P network
- Focus on confidentiality (no KYC, use of Tor)
- Non-custodial (you retain control of your funds)
- Open source (AGPL)

### Differences with Bisq 1

**For buyers:**


- No security deposit required
- No trading fees
- No mining fees
- Security based on vendor reputation
- Lower trading limits (equivalent to USD 600)

**For sellers:**


- No security deposit required
- Building a reputation
- Possibility of burning BSQ or creating BSQ bonds
- Potentially higher sales premium (10-15% above market)

**Important note:** Once the Bisq Multisig protocol has been implemented in Bisq 2, the old version of Bisq can be phased out. However, Bisq 1 will continue to be used as a management tool for the Bisq CAD and for BSQ-BTC exchanges.

### Exchange process


- The creator of the offer defines the terms of the exchange
- Once the traders have agreed on the terms (payment method and price), the exchange begins
- The seller sends his bank details to the buyer, and the buyer sends his Bitcoin address to the seller
- Buyer makes payment in cash and notifies seller
- Once payment has been received, the seller sends the bitcoins to the buyer's address
- The exchange is complete when the buyer receives the bitcoins

### Important rules


- Before exchanging payment details, the exchange can be cancelled without justification
- After details have been exchanged, failure to meet obligations may result in banishment
- For bank transfers, **never use the terms "Bisq" or "Bitcoin "** in the reason for payment (this could lead to the funds being frozen or even cause the recipient's or payer's bank account to be blocked)
- Traders must log on at least once a day to follow the process
- In the event of a problem, traders can call on the services of a mediator

## Installation and configuration

### 1. Download and Verify Bisq 2

Pre-configuring payment methods is optional, but recommended to save time when trading. You can also configure your payment methods directly during a trade by contacting your exchange partner.

### 5. Account security

**Data backup:**

Unlike Bisq 1, Bisq 2 does not currently integrate a Bitcoin wallet: transactions are therefore carried out via your own external wallets. Nevertheless, we recommend that you regularly back up your Bisq 2 data folder. To locate your data folder, consult the [official Bisq wiki](https://bisq.wiki/Backing_up_application_data#Back_up_the_entire_Bisq_data_directory).

**Identity management:**

Bisq 2 lets you create multiple identities. Each identity can be used for different types of transaction. Your identities are stored in the data folder.

### How to sell Bitcoins?

The selling process on Bisq 2 follows a similar logic to that of buying, with the same main steps but in reverse order. You can either create your own offer to sell, or respond to an existing offer to buy. Here's a breakdown of the various options and stages in the process:

**Option 1: Create an offer to sell**


- Select "Bisq Easy" then "Offerbook"
- Click on "Create offer" and choose "Sell Bitcoin"
- Configure your offer :
 - Select currency (EUR, USD, etc.)
 - Choose the accepted payment methods
 - Set the amount (between 6 and 600 USD equivalent)
 - Set your price (fixed or % of market)
- Check details and publish the offer

**Option 2: Take up an existing offer**


- Browse offers in the "Offerbook" tab
- Filter by currency and payment method
- Select an offer that suits you
- Check details and accept the offer

**Sales process:**

Once the exchange has been initiated :


   - Send your bank details to the buyer
   - Wait for the buyer's Bitcoin address
   - Check that the address is valid

After payment notification :


   - Check that payment has been received on your account
   - Confirm that the amount and details match
   - Send bitcoins to the address provided
   - Mark the transaction as completed

Finalization :


   - Wait for confirmation from the buyer
   - Leave feedback on the transaction
   - Build your reputation for future sales

**Important note:** As a seller, you need to be particularly vigilant about the risk of chargebacks. Give preference to secure payment methods, and always check that payment has been received before sending bitcoins.

## Good Practices and Safety

### Safety Tips

**For buyers:**


- Start with small amounts
- Check sellers' reputations (minimum score of 30,000)
- Use only the suggested payment methods
- Check that the seller is active before sending payment

**For sellers:**


- Be careful with new accounts
- Avoid payment methods sensitive to chargebacks (PayPal, Venmo)
- Check that the account details correspond to the buyer
- Limit communication to chat Bisq 2
- Open a mediation in case of doubt

### Reputation building (for salespeople)

To enhance your reputation on Bisq as a seller, conduct regular transactions and maintain professional communication with buyers. Respond quickly to buyer requests to ensure a positive experience. You can also create a BSQ bond to show your commitment to the platform. These actions will build trust and attract more buyers.

### Dispute Resolution
