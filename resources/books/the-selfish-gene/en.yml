  The Selfish Gene by Richard Dawkins is a book that explores the topic of evolution and genetics from the perspective of genes as the fundamental unit of selection, as opposed to individuals or species. Dawkins argues that genes are the key to understanding the behavior of living organisms, and that many seemingly altruistic behaviors can be explained by the fact that they ultimately benefit the genes that are responsible for them. The book is known for popularizing the concept of the "meme", a cultural unit of information that is subject to the same evolutionary principles as genes. The Selfish Gene is a seminal work in the field of evolutionary biology and has had a significant impact on our understanding of the role of genes in evolution.
