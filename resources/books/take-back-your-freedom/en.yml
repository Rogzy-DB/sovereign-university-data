  In the future, humanity is completely controlled by the AI-managed “Fiat Network.” At the helm of this network is the massive AI known as “Dr. Fiat,” which oversees all economic activity. Governments and banks have become mere shells of their former selves, and economic inequality has accelerated. People have lost their freedom, and society now values individuals solely based on their credit scores.

  Amidst this dystopian reality, a group of rebels rises—Yuki and his comrades, known as the “Resistance.” These young revolutionaries believe in a free economy and seek to reclaim value exchange through decentralized networks. They study the history of money from ancient times, exposing the problems caused by fiat currency and advocating for the potential of Bitcoin as an alternative.

  However, Dr. Fiat is an overwhelming force. Through its AI-driven network, it manipulates the global economic system, suppressing dissenters by freezing assets and arbitrarily altering credit scores to erase them from society. Despite being few in number, the Resistance believes in the power of Bitcoin and stands against Dr. Fiat.

  Can Yuki and his allies liberate the world from Dr. Fiat and restore economic freedom to the people? This grand tale, blending knowledge and adventure, offers a journey through the history of money and the revolutionary potential of Bitcoin. And so, the quiet struggle begins…
