  The Moral Case for Fossil Fuels by Alex Epstein is a book that presents a contrarian argument for the continued use of fossil fuels, despite their negative impact on the environment. The author contends that fossil fuels have played a vital role in human progress and that efforts to phase them out prematurely would be disastrous for the economy and the environment. Epstein challenges many commonly held assumptions about fossil fuels and argues that they have brought more benefits than harm to human society. He also advocates for a more objective, fact-based approach to the debate on energy policy. The book presents a thought-provoking perspective on a controversial topic and is recommended for readers interested in environmental ethics, energy policy, and economics.
