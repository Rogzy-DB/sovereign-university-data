  Fiat Money Inflation in France," written by Andrew Dickson White in 1896, is a seminal examination of the economic crisis that transpired after the French Revolution. The book scrutinizes the catastrophic consequences of uncontrolled money printing and the over-reliance on fiat currency, which led to hyperinflation and economic turmoil in post-revolutionary France.

  White's work serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of monetary policies not backed by physical reserves, demonstrating the disastrous impact of inflation on a society's economy and structure. This insightful historical analysis remains highly relevant for modern readers, providing important lessons about economic policy, fiscal responsibility, and the real-world implications of financial decisions made by governments.
