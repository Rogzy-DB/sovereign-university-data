  Bitcoin is resistance money, empowering its users to resist authoritarians,
  inflation, surveillance, censorship, and financial exclusion. Resistance Money
  examines bitcoin’s monetary policy, censorship-resistance, privacy, inclusion,
  and energy use to develop a comprehensive and measured case that bitcoin is a
  net benefit to the world, despite its imperfections. Bitcoin isn’t just for
  criminals, speculators, or wealthy Silicon Valley entrepreneurs – despite what
  the headlines say. It is, instead, a tool for anyone on the margins. The book is
  rigorous but accessible; Resistance Money is intended for all, from the clueless
  to the specialist, from the proponent to the die-hard skeptic, and everyone in
  between.
