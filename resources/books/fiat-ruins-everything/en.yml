  You are being stolen from. Your money is being debased, your labor is being
  debased, your civilization and all of its institutions are being debased. You're
  having to work longer for less pay. You see your friends and family less and
  less. You eat worse food, you sleep a little less, and your neighborhood gets a
  little more impersonal every year. Your life is getting worse, and you are
  paying for someone else's excess. How did this happen, and why is it happening?
  Fiat Ruins Everything is an analysis of the debasement of the modern world from
  our banking system and real estate to our educational system and art. Learn why
  these systems keep getting worse and why Bitcoin will make things better.

  Fiat Ruins Everything delivers a knockout punch, unmasking the pervasive destruction caused by the fiat currency system while highlighting the hope found in Bitcoin. The riveting narrative cuts to the heart of societyâ€™s ills and exposes the dark truth of our current financial system while also offering a transformative vision for the future. This is essential reading for anyone that feels played by the current system but knows, deep down inside, that prosperity and abundance can still be achieved.
