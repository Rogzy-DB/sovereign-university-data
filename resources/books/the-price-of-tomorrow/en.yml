  The Price of Tomorrow: Why Deflation is the Key to an Abundant Future" by Jeff Booth is a book that examines the impact of technology on our economy and how it is driving deflation. The author argues that as technology continues to advance and prices fall, our current economic system, which is built on inflation, is becoming increasingly unsustainable. The book explores the history of technological innovation and its impact on economies throughout history, as well as the potential consequences of continuing to rely on an inflationary monetary system. It offers a thought-provoking look at the future of our economy and the changes that will be necessary to adapt to a rapidly evolving technological landscape.
