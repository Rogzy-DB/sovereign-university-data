  I’m a marketing expert and former CMO (Chief Marketing Officer) of global companies, turned into a independent journalist when the void left by the mainstream media and their lies became too big to bear. I strive to uncover the hidden truth from Israel and report it to the world, and bring the world’s hidden reality to uninformed Israelis. I’m also an activist, public speaker, a Podcaster, a Twitter Spaces host, and I write on my Substack and "Bereshit News" - a non-censored newspaper in Israel. I'm also mum to a 14 years old gorgeous boy. 
  Join my telegram & Twitter for frequent updates, and support my work. If you'd like to interview me for your Podcast/publication, please DM me on Twitter, or reach out on any other platform.
