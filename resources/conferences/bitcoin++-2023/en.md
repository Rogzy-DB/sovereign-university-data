# P2WSH Room

## (Workshop)Getting started with LDK Node

![video](https://youtu.be/B1YC8nJdc4s)

Speaker: Conor Okus + Jeff Czyz

Conor Okus and Jeff Czyz of Spiral presents: LDK Node is a ready-to-go Lightning node implementation based on LDK. It wraps the full suite of LDK APIs and provides a simpler API so you can get started quickly. In this interactive workshop, you'll learn how to use LDK Node to set up a simple Lightning node with a BDK-based on-chain wallet and blockchain access via Esplora. At the start of the workshop, we'll generate a lightning invoice on regtest that will expire before the lesson finishes. The first one to pay with their newly built node wins the race!

## Towards a Validity Rollup on Bitcoin with Taproot

Speaker: Simanta Gautam

## Stablesats: Bringing Stability to Bitcoin

![video](https://youtu.be/S_rKMNbcoNk)

Speaker: Kody Low

Kody Low of Fedimint //Base58 presents: One problem that persists for people in a Bitcoin economy is the short-term volatility of the bitcoin exchange rate. When the bitcoin price drops, it can lessen the purchasing power of sats and make it harder to pay for dollar-priced goods and services. This workshop will introduce Stablesats, a Lightning based protocol which allows people to hold “dollar equivalent” balances in their Lightning wallet.

## Simple Layer Twos

![video](https://youtu.be/yPkGjpvofNM?si=ZHsSXxKk5a4Bjty5)

Speaker: Christian Lewe (@uncomputable)

Christian Lewe of Blockstream Research (clewe) presents on: Simplicity is a proposed overhaul of the scripting language of Bitcoin. It fundamentally changes what can be done on layer one, but it does not stop there. Given what was possible with the existing scripts so far, imagine the explosion of ideas that Simplicity would enable. In this talk, we explore some of those applications, including Validity rollups and Fedimint accounts.

## Unjamming Lightning Network

![video](https://youtu.be/S7ZH4hr2FlA)

Speaker: Clara Shikhelman

Clara Shikhelman from Chaincode Labs presents: While it may not be easy to steal funds on the Lightning Network, it is relatively simple and cheap to jam channels. This can result in users not being able to send or receive payment, lost revenue for routing nodes, or even degradation of the whole network’s ability to make payments.
In this presentation, we will delve into the consequences of such attacks, explore potential mitigation strategies, and discuss various implications for the Lightning Network.
