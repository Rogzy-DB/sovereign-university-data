  The "Zum Wilden Michel" farm is located in the heart of the beautiful Black Forest. Nature lovers and hikers, camping fans and outdoor enthusiasts, motorcyclists and cyclists are all very welcome. Music and culture fans will also get their money's worth here. We have something going on almost every week. From rock to brass music, from electronic music to theater and cabaret. In our rustic restaurant you will be spoiled with culinary delicacies from the region. We buy locally and make everything in-house - a different special every weekend. We can easily accommodate 120 people on the campsite , in the holiday apartments and in the dormitory . There are also some particularly unusual accommodation options! You want to get married ? Celebrate a bachelor party? Enjoy a variety of concerts in a special location? Have a team event or anniversary with your company? Celebrate a big birthday? Stand together and dance with motorbikes, tractors or other noisy vehicles? Or just celebrate SOMETHING? Then we are exactly the right people for you! Because things can get loud and wild here.
