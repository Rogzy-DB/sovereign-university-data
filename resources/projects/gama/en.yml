  Green Africa Mining Alliance is made of companies from African countries, each year a member company hosts an event in their country. GAMA's purpose is to bring the renewable bitcoin mining companies in Africa under an umbrella where they can work together to: increase the geographic spread of mining around the world, assist new miners and mining organizations to find and target renewable energy sources in Africa, catalyze the electrification of Africa by helping energy companies find new communities and locations that need more energy, and provide a base of organizations from which a future bitcoin mining pool can start and grow.
