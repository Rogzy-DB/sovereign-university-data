  While Bitcoin FilmFest will regularly host and participate in events locally and abroad, Warsaw serves as BFF’s home base. Held in the iconic Palace of Culture and Science—a unique building erected on Stalin’s orders—for a few days each year, it brings the message of decentralization and freedom to a venue that was once a symbol of central control. No matter how great they are, Bitcoin FilmFest goes beyond a series of events. In fact, it also serves as a networking platform, the Bitcoin Cinema Hub, that brings together the fiercest minds from many areas—independent creators, filmmakers, producers, freedom-seekers, and cinema fans.
