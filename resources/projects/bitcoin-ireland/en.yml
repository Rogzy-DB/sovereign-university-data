  We are a group of individuals passionate about Bitcoin & the possibilities it may offer, both to the people of Ireland & the businesses that operate here.
  Our mission is to connect Irish based Bitcoiners, support & promote Bitcoin friendly businesses, educate the public & provide an online resource for anyone who's interested in learning more. We do this because we believe Bitcoin can help make the world a better place.
