  Driven by the belief that Bitcoin is the best way to save money, we are raising a new generation of long-term investors, by giving them simple, user-friendly, and secure access to Bitcoin. 

  Founded in Switzerland by Julian Liniger and Adem Bilican after they struggled to find a safe, hassle-free space for buying bitcoin, Relai is making bitcoin saving and investment accessible for everyone. The bitcoin-only app is designed to be simple and intuitive, enabling anyone in Europe to buy and sell bitcoin within minutes, with no need for registration, verification, or deposits. Independently audited, and with over 50 million CHF of bitcoin invested through its platform, Relai is giving consumers the chance to unlock new means of saving and investing.
