  Founded in 2019 by Niko Laamanen, Konsensus Network began with the Finnish translation of 'The Bitcoin Standard' by Saifedean Ammous. It soon grew into a vibrant, freedom-loving team of volunteers passionate about bitcoin, leading to the localization of the book in Portuguese and Dutch. As a bitcoin-only company, we have published over 50 books so far, operating as a bridge between authors, translators, and distribution channels.

  Our mission revolves around making bitcoin, Austrian economics, and sovereignty more accessible through localized literature. We believe bitcoin's potential is enormous and want to share this knowledge with the world. We didn't expect to end up in book publishing, but we are committed to enabling everyone to comprehend the transformative power of decentralized money.

  We are structured as a 'starfish organization,' a decentralized, leaderless organization model that thrives on rapid adaptability and the dedication of volunteers. Each participant brings their unique skills to the table, contributing to and benefiting from our collective work. This model enables quick decision-making and effective responses to challenges, empowering our community towards our shared goal.
