  OSMO provides financial solutions in Guatemala, Mexico, Costa Rica, and soon El Salvador, using bitcoin in the backend without users needing to handle BTC directly. Customers hold and send fiat while OSMO converts to and from bitcoin. This approach makes cross-border transactions faster and cheaper than traditional bank transfers.
