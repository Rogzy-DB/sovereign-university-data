  Berl√≠n El Salvador is an initiative launched in 2023 to establish a circular economy in a local town. After local and international volunteers began the education project, they expanded to create a Bitcoin center. This center offers Bitcoin education, English classes, and entrepreneurship training.
  Additionally, it hosts a podcast and regular meetups, and organized the first Economia Bitcoin conference in April 2024. The town is now one of the fastest-growing Bitcoin communities globally, with over 120 businesses accepting Bitcoin.
