  Mi Primer Bitcoin is an international educational project focused on Bitcoin, with a special emphasis on El Salvador. Its main objective is to provide impartial and high-quality information about Bitcoin, particularly after El Salvador became the first country to recognize Bitcoin as legal tender. They offer free classes ranging from general concepts to more advanced technical aspects, with the goal of making Bitcoin learning accessible and straightforward for students.

  The project is experiencing rapid growth, with headquarters in San Salvador and San Miguel, and classes in various departments of El Salvador. They also hold monthly meetings and have expansion plans for the upcoming year, including a diploma program in public high schools. In addition to education, Mi Primer Bitcoin aims to foster a circular economy and a thriving Bitcoin community in El Salvador.

  The philosophy and mission of Mi Primer Bitcoin focus on providing unbiased and high-quality Bitcoin education, without endorsing products or engaging in political debates. Their goal is to empower individuals to make their own informed decisions about Bitcoin and create a positive example in El Salvador and beyond.
