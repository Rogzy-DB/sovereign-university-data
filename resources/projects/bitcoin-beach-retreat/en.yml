  Starting in ’21 with a two night gathering of 35 intrepid anons from Bitcoin Twitter and including an impromptu Lightning workshop & quiz, growing in ’22 & ’23 into a three night sold out event with 100 Bitcoiners including 11 peers kindly doing workshops/talks. We are not a conference where speakers are booked in advance. Bitcoiners book onto the Retreat and we crowdsource any talks & activities from there as we are blessed to be surrounded by peers with skills to share.
