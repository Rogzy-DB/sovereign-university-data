  we believe in Bitcoin as a next generation politically neutral monetary system, the foundation for decentralized finance of the future. While Bitcoin is an efficient settlement layer, it needs a Layer-2 solution for everyday transactions. That is why we support development of the Lightning Network - an essential step towards decentralized finance.
