  An idea, no matter how simple, is bulletproof. Indestructible, invincible. An idea can be conveyed eternally. Thus, Agora 256 was born of an idea; to document our ascent to digital sovereignty, to prosperity without having to ask permission.
  We live in an undeniable dystopia, where the state promotes itself in broad daylight as an omniscient entity. Our freedoms are being eroded in favor of stifling centralized control. Nevertheless, we have the tools with which to build a reality based on the principles of autonomy, responsibility, meritocracy and freedom.

  The name Agora256 was born from the combination of two concepts

  The term Agora evokes the agorist philosophy.
  Without limiting ourselves to this particular school of thought, we consider ourselves anarcho-capitalists and firmly believe in the virtues of free markets.
  The number 256 refers to the SHA-256 hashing algorithm used by the Bitcoin monetary network.
  Change comes from the individual and his or her informed choices, which is why the Agora 256 project strives to encourage the creation of strong, reliable networks of trust between people of action who refuse the top-down governance of self-appointed elites.
  Each individual can and must choose his or her own path. With Agora 256, we want to help you adopt a path towards self-respecting sovereignty.

  It is with this in mind that the content on this website is intended to be delivered. The tools and guides we propose here are the same ones we use personally, and which we believe our audience will also benefit from.
  It is our duty to defend our privacy if we want to have one.
