  CUBO+ marks the beginning of a pioneering educational initiative aimed at forming a community of Salvadoran professionals trained to meet the growing demand for employment by Bitcoin and Lightning Network companies, as well as to drive adoption and foster economic development in El Salvador.

  We are committed to equipping students with the skills and knowledge necessary to join the Bitcoin industry and contribute to reshaping the financial system.

  We are a program committed to teaching young talented minds the fundamentals of Bitcoin at a dedicated and deep level, as well as the most advanced details. We advocate for the involvement of Salvadorans in the Bitcoin revolution in El Salvador, without barriers or limitations.

  We aim to build a thriving and free community of sovereign and independent individuals. Our mission is to create Bitcoin professionals who will build the country and the world we all want to live in!
