  Start9 aims to resolve the issue of trust in today's digital world where data control is a major concern. 

  The company provides you the power to own and control your data by running a personal server, which was traditionally accessible only to tech-savvy individuals or affluent entities. With Start9, you can run a full Bitcoin node to verify transactions, a Lightning node to gain full custody over your Bitcoin on the Lightning Network, and essentially become your own digital entity. This is made possible through EmbassyOS, a browser-based operating system for personal servers. Despite the potentially daunting nature of running a personal server, Start9 assures comprehensive customer support, including a detailed user manual, FAQ, tutorials, and direct access to a technical expert community.
