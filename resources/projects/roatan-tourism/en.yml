  Roatan Tourism Bureau is a private, Non-Governmental Organization (NGO), which aims to encourage and promote the vitality & growth of Roatan's tourism industry. Promoting Roatan, as a premier travel island destination (both domestically & internationally) is at the center of the Bureau's principal focus. Roatan.Online was launched in early 2017 as an online magazine and travel forum. Later that year, we launched the Roatan Tourism Bureau as a privately funded venture dedicated to the promotion of Roatan and its supporters. Our purpose is to improve the online presence for Roatan through the latest web marketing techniques and the newest online platforms and mediums available.
