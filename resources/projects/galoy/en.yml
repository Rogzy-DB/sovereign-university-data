  Galoy offers an open-source core banking platform designed to launch enterprise-scale Bitcoin and Lightning applications. It provides accelerated development of Bitcoin banking solutions through self-hosted infrastructure or a managed "Banking-as-a-Service" implementation.

  The platform enables organizations to launch a Bitcoin community bank using a shared custody model and an easy-to-use Lightning wallet. It's the same technology that helped Bitcoin Beach build a circular economy. This proven infrastructure can also be used by governments to provide 21st-century financial services to anyone with a mobile phone and an internet connection.

  Founded on the belief that Bitcoin is money, Galoy empowers organizations of any size to create their own Bitcoin-based bank. It was the backbone of the Bitcoin Beach Wallet project in El Zonte, El Salvador, which was instrumental in developing a sustainable Bitcoin economy and has seen significant growth since the country's adoption of Bitcoin as legal tender.

  Galoy is the bridge for organizations looking to integrate with the Lightning network, and a beacon for open-source contributors striving to build a better financial system.
