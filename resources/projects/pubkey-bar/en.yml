  PubKey is a bar in New York City that decided to accept bitcoin via the Lightning Network to reduce middleman costs and demonstrate bitcoinâ€™s everyday use. In addition to drawing the local bitcoin community, they save on credit card fees (3.5% or more) and offer fast, direct payments. A notable event was when President Trump became the first U.S. president to make a purchase with bitcoin there.
