  Welcome! We’re CoinCorner, a team of friendly and enthusiastic people, working together to make Bitcoin as easy for you as possible.
  Like most things in life, we started by realising the solution to a problem. Back in 2014, it was hard to buy Bitcoin in the UK and even harder to buy it from somewhere you trusted.
  Enter CoinCorner. From day one, our aim has been to make buying Bitcoin quick and easy for people in the UK and around the world.
  Calling the Isle of Man our home, we’ve made huge strides to build trust in the Bitcoin industry. From working extensively with the Isle of Man Government on Bitcoin regulation to educating people from all walks of life through the media, public talks, and more.
  After attracting global attention in 2017, Bitcoin has become a household name with more interest in the digital currency than ever before. Don’t worry though, we come to work every day ready to cut through the confusion around Bitcoin, making it accessible for anyone and everyone who wants to be involved.
