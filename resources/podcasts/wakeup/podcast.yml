  The world is largely asleep. 
  We're living in a time where our freedoms are slowly being encroached upon, but because we're addicted to mediocre bullshit, we ignore it. 
  Our money no longer represents our work, time or effort, the freedom to speak out is obstructed under the guise of "diversity, inclusion and safety", privacy is no longer respected and surveillance has become mainstream "for our protection".
  Wake up is dedicated to helping ensure V for Vendetta and 1984 remain works of fiction.
  Topics will include Bitcoin, Money, Freedom, Philosophy, Psychology, Science, Ethics & more
