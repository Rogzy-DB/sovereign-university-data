  Hello and welcome to Bitcoin.Review. Scratching my own itch, this is a best efforts place to talk about Bitcoin (and Nostr) Project software updates and some other commentary that I find interesting or noteworthy to me. I also would like to invite you to send Bitcoin related questions via the bitcoin.review's website.
